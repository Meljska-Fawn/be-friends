## Description

For this project, I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Credits

I referenced the mini-project and other activities from the NoSQL material for how to set up my models, routes, controllers, and config files. My tutor Dominque Meeks Gombe helped with writing the functions to get friends and thoughts assigned to users in the utils files.
